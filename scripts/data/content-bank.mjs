/* Pre-written queue for the daily GitHub Actions publisher (see
   .github/workflows/daily.yml + scripts/05-publish-daily.mjs). Unlike
   getbiostar's fact-driven pages, shayari has to be freshly composed, so
   this file is a bank of already-written, ready-to-publish posts that the
   workflow pops from N-at-a-time — no AI/API call needed at run time.
   When this list runs low, extend it (a normal Claude Code session can
   pull the next keywords with `node scripts/02-next-keywords.mjs N` and
   write more entries in this shape) and push. */
